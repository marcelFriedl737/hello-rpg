This project uses Pygame to create a simple game where you control Steve, a red square, using the WASD keys. Collect green power-ups to increase Steve's strength and size. See the `projects/` folder for feature and task breakdowns.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   python3 -m pip install pygame
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python3 steve_game.py
   ```
